      <p>The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human
         events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected 
         them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to 
         which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of 
         mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

        We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by 
        their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit 
        of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their 
        just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes 
        destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute 
        new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as 
        to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate 
        that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly
         all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than 
         to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of 
         abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under 
         absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide
          new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and 
          such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The 
          history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all 
          having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, 
          let Facts be submitted to a candid world.
