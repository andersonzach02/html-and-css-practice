    <h1>This is the biggest heading for the top of my page</h1>
    <h2>This is the second biggest heading</h2>

    <h2 class="typewriter">This heading is in typewriter text.</h2>

    <h1 class="italicized">This text is italicized using a generic class</h1>

    <h3>This is a heading that should be centered on the page</h3>

    <p>Some of this <i>text</i> will be <em>italicized</em> and 
      <b>some</b> of it will be <strong>bold</strong></p>

    <p class="typewriter">This paragraph <span class="emphasized">is also</span> in typewriter text</p>

    <p class="pretty">
      This paragraph should be justified, unlike all of the other ones which by 
      default are left aligned and result in a jagged right edge look to the text 
      which is nice becuase it makes it so that the text on the screen looks neater
      and more organized. At this point, however, I feel too lazy to write out a
      paragraph that is long enough to dislplay text that reaches the end of the window
      and shows the justify text so now I am just free association writing until there
      is enough text on the html page
    </p>

    <p>This is all one<br> paragraph but I've separated<br> lines with the break tag</p>

    <p class="important">Warning: We have no slow lorises here.</p>

    <p class="indented">This paragraph should be indented on the webpage</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>This paragraph should be smaller and blue, as it is enclosed in a blockquote tag and I have
        styled blockquotes to be small and blue
      </p>

      <p>This paragraph is also in the blockquote tag, and is separate from the first paragraph</p>

      <p>The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human
         events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected 
         them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to 
         which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of 
         mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

        We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by 
        their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit 
        of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their 
        just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes 
        destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute 
        new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as 
        to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate 
        that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly
         all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than 
         to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of 
         abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under 
         absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide
          new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and 
          such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The 
          history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all 
          having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, 
          let Facts be submitted to a candid world.

    <p>This paragraph contains some <span class="redout">red text</span> in it</p>

    <p class="roomier">This should be a very spacious <br> paragraph between words, letters, and lines</p>

    <p class="separated">This paragraph should be much more separated from other paragraphs and things 
      than the other paragraphs, headings, etc. that are on this page because I have applied a margin to 
      this paragraph's text.
    </p>

    <h1 class="dot_enclosed">
      This heading should have a purple dotted border enclosing it which is nice because it looks
      pretty.

    <h4>This heading should be centered</h4>

    <p class="centered">This paragraph should also be centered because its class is grouped with
      the style that centers the h4 heading above.
    </p>

    <h2 id="halloween">This text should be orange because it has a class tied to this heading's unique
      id which cannot be given to any other element on the webpage.

      <p>This paragraph is inside of the same div as the header above it.
        Thus, they should have the same styling!
