    <h1>This is the biggest heading for the top of my page</h1>
    <h2>This is the second biggest heading</h2>

    <h2 class="typewriter">This heading is in typewriter text.</h2>

    <h1 class="italicized">This text is italicized using a generic class</h1>

    <h3>This is a heading that should be centered on the page</h3>

    <p>Some of this <i>text</i> will be <em>italicized</em> and 
      <b>some</b> of it will be <strong>bold</strong></p>

    <p class="typewriter">This paragraph <span class="emphasized">is also</span> in typewriter text</p>

    <p class="pretty">
      This paragraph should be justified, unlike all of the other ones which by 
      default are left aligned and result in a jagged right edge look to the text 
      which is nice becuase it makes it so that the text on the screen looks neater
      and more organized. At this point, however, I feel too lazy to write out a
      paragraph that is long enough to dislplay text that reaches the end of the window
      and shows the justify text so now I am just free association writing until there
      is enough text on the html page
    </p>

    <p>This is all one<br> paragraph but I've separated<br> lines with the break tag</p>

    <p class="important">Warning: We have no slow lorises here.</p>

    <p>This paragraph contains some <span class="redout">red text</span> in it</p>

    <p class="roomier">This should be a very spacious <br> paragraph between words, letters, and lines</p>
